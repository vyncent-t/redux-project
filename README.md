# Redux project

This project is a mock store meant to use react and redux methods in place of react context in order to refactor the store. The user should be able to sign up on the main page and log back in once signing out, all the while also being able to browse and shop. If the user is not logged in they are also able to browse the shop as a guest, adding items to their cart. The user is able to navigate the store inventory via category buttons and is taken to a large more descriptive page once clicking on the item.

## tools

This project was built with react, mongodb mongoose, graphql, react redux, and stripe

## Installation
